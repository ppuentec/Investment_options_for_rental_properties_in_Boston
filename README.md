# Investment_options_for_rental_properties_in_Boston
This is a project where I am learning to document a repository in GitHub. The topic of my project is related to the analysis of AirBnB data in the Boston market. I will conduct a basic analysis that can be expanded to a more complex model to predict rental revenue from any property in the Boston area.

In the second part of this project, I will create a blog post to share my project and project findings with a non-technical audience.

# Project Description
In this document, I will provide a high level description of the code used and how to install it. The code include many notes for each step that I will not include here since it will be repetitive.
The initial dataset is contained in the 'listings.csv' file taken from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston
The next step involved data wrangling activities such as loading the file into a Jupyter notebook, explore the data to find useful data to be used in the analysis. My analysis focused on small properties: House and Apartments with up to two bedrooms and up to two bathrooms.
The nest stap involved assessing the data where I checked for data quality and data tidiness.
The final dataset included only 14 columns with information such as property type, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, availability.

In the analysis, I was able to build an 'occupancy rate' and 'average daily rate' columns to better understand which type of property can be more profitable. Towads the end of the analysis, I was able to estimate r-squared values for a simple model with categorical variables and dummy variables.

# Installation
The instalation of the code should be pretty simple since it was developed in a Jupyter notebook. The code is in this repository as well.
